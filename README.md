This is a browser-based online wall-to-wall game. You can play against a computer with artificial intelligence and test your nerves for strength.

In the folder algorithm/rus.txt there is a brief description of the algorithm and the program files.

The game is not finished and requires minor fixes.

In the future, it is planned:
- correct the logic of the application when downloading the game (necessarily!)
- add a readable README (necessarily!)
- slightly fix the div with the history of user and computer moves (necessarily!)
- add a backend with a personal account to save the results (feature!)
